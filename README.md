This package aims to provide different summation algorithms for use in N-body problems. Each algorithm has a mathematical specification and some details regarding the implementation that are encoded in the type domain. The mathematical specifications gives the name of the summation algorithm, while the implementation details such as parallelization are given as type parameters.
